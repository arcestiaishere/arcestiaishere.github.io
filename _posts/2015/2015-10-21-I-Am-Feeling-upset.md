***Warning, maybe some bad word will coming in this post***

I Finally know that she was like someone else. <br>
I can do nothing, i was nobody for her. <br>
I just can stay away from her, hope she happy with her boy. <br>
I realize she was not for me. <br>
I try to stand back, but maybe i will hard to forgetting you. <br>

English Translation

There are times I wish my heart was small <br>
So my longing for you disappears <br>
There are moments I wish time won't flow <br>
So your scent doesnt fade away

Bridge: <br>
Sing to free all worries you've had <br>
Say it loud and don't regret <br>
I love you~ <br>
I will tell you all that's been on my mind

CHORUS: <br>
The sun fell into darkness <br>
Sank in sadness <br>
There's so much in my mint you don't get <br>
Is it the sunset pitch black <br>
Or it's my heart <br>
The hope all burned down to ash

Verse2: <br>
Simple melody will ease the pain <br>
Still the mind tries to hold onto you <br>
Piece of memories will always stay <br>
i am frozen since you're away

BRIDGE <br>
CHORUS <br>
I keep all burning feelings in the heart shaped box <br>
So i watch you from afar <br>
One day you fall into some other warm safe arms <br>
I will wait for you inside your dream <br>
I will tell you all that's been on my mind...
