***Warning, maybe some bad word will coming in this post***

I Finally know that she was like someone else. <br>
I can do nothing, i was nobody for her. <br>
I just can stay away from her, hope she happy with her boy. <br>
I realize she was not for me. <br>
I try to stand back, but maybe i will hard to forgetting you. <br>

Check this song, Vietnamese Song that take my heart on it.

English Translation

There are times I wish my heart was small
So my longing for you disappears
There are moments I wish time won't flow
So your scent doesnt fade away

Bridge:
Sing to free all worries you've had
Say it loud and don't regret
I love you~
I will tell you all that's been on my mind

CHORUS:
The sun fell into darkness
Sank in sadness
There's so much in my mint you don't get
Is it the sunset pitch black
Or it's my heart
The hope all burned down to ash

Verse2:
Simple melody will ease the pain
Still the mind tries to hold onto you
Piece of memories will always stay
i am frozen since you're away

BRIDGE
CHORUS
I keep all burning feelings in the heart shaped box
So i watch you from afar
One day you fall into some other warm safe arms
I will wait for you inside your dream
I will tell you all that's been on my mind...
